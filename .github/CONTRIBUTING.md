# TwitchDB Contribution Guidelines

## Creating an Issue
 - Important: Make sure you do not use the issue tracker as a chat room.
 - Make sure your issue is directly related to TwitchDB
 - **Support requests are not bugs.** Issues such as "How do I do this" are not bugs and are closed as soon as a collaborator spots it.
 - **No generic titles** such as "Question", "Help", "Crash Report" etc. If an issue has a generic title they will either be closed on the spot, or a collaborator will edit it to describe the actual symptom.
 - Information must be provided in the issue body, not in the title. No tags are allowed in the title, and do not change the title if the issue has been solved.
 - Similarly, no generic issue reports. It is the issue submitter's responsibility to provide us an issue that is **trackable, debuggable, reproducible, reported professionally and is an actual bug**. If you do not provide us with a summary or instructions on how to reproduce the issue, it is a support request until the actual bug has been found and therefore the issue is closed.

### Closing Issues
To keep the bug tracker clear of non-related issues and to prevent it from overflowing, **issues must be closed as soon as possible** (This may sound unethical, but it is MUCH better than having the BUG TRACKER filled with SUPPORT REQUESTS and "I NEED HELP").

If an issue does not conform to the "Creating an Issue" guidelines above, the issue should be closed.

## Contributing Code
* Use the [Pull Request](https://github.com/DistortedNet/TwitchDB/pull/new) system, your request will be checked and discussed.
* __Create a single branch for that pull request__
* The code must be clear and written in English, comments included.
* Use descriptive commit titles
* If you are copying or merging code into TwitchDB, appropriate credit to the original author and your source must be given in the description and added to the README file of the repository.
